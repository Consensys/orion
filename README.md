## Project Deprecation
Now that all primary Orion functionality has been merged into Tessera, Orion is being deprecated.  
We encourage all users with active projects to use the provided migration instructions,
documented [here](https://docs.orion.consensys.net/en/latest/Tutorials/Migrating-from-Orion-to-Tessera/).

We will continue to support Orion users until 30th November 2021. If you have any questions or
concerns, please reach out to the ConsenSys protocol engineering team in the
[#orion channel on Discord](https://discord.gg/hYpHRjK) or by [email](mailto:quorum@consensys.net).
