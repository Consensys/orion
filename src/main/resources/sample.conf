## Orion configuration file example
## ---------------------------------

##
## The only strictly necessary options are `nodeUrl`, `nodePort` and `ethPort`, however it's recommended to
## set at least the following:
##
##   --nodeUrl           The URL to advertise to other nodes (reachable by them)
##   --nodePort          The local nodePort to listen on
##   --ethPort       The nodePort for private apis to listen on
##   --workdir       The folder to put stuff in (default: .)
##   --othernodes    "Boot nodes" to connect to to discover the network
##   --publickeys    Public keys hosted by this node
##   --privatekeys   Private keys hosted by this node (in corresponding order)
##
##
## Note on defaults: "Default:" below indicates the value that will be assumed
## if the option is not present.
##

## Externally accessible URL for this node's public API This is what is advertised to other nodes
## on the network and must be reachable by them.
## Default: http://127.0.0.1:8080/
nodeurl = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/"

## Port to listen on for the Orion API.
## Default: 8080
nodeport = 8080

## Network interface to which the Orion API will bind.
## Default: 127.0.0.1
nodeinterface = "127.0.0.1"

## Internally accessible URL for this node's public API This is what is advertised to other nodes
## on the network and must be reachable by them.
## Default: http://127.0.0.1:8888/
clienturl = "http://127.0.0.1:8888/"

## Port to listen on for the Ethereum client API.
## Default: 8888
clientport = 8888

## Network interface to which the Ethereum client API will bind.
## Default: 127.0.0.1
clientinterface = "127.0.0.1"

## Directory to which paths to all other files referenced in the config are relative to.
##
## Default: The current directory
workdir = "data"

## Initial list of other nodes in the network. Orion will automatically connect to other nodes
## not in this list that are advertised by the nodes below, so these can be considered the "boot
## nodes."
##
## Default: []
othernodes = ["http://127.0.0.1:9000/"]

## The set of public keys this node will host.
##
## Default: []
##
publickeys = ["foo.pub"]

## The corresponding set of private keys. These must correspond to the public keys listed
## 'publickeys'.
##
## Default: []
privatekeys = ["foo.key"]

## The path at which to locate the lib sodium shared library
##
## Default: depends on the operational system, check the class LibSodiumSettings for more details
libsodiumpath = "/usr/local/lib/libsodium.dylib"

## Optional comma-separated list of paths to public keys to add as recipients for every
## transaction sent through this node, e.g. for backup purposes. These keys must be advertised by
## some Orion node on the network, i.e. be in a node's 'publickeys/privatekeys' lists.
##
## Default: []
alwayssendto = []

## Optional containing the passwords needed to unlock the given 'privatekeys'. The file
## should contain one password per line -- add an empty line if any one key isn't locked.
##
## Default: Not Set
#passwords =

## Storage engine used to save payloads and related information. Options:
##
##   - leveldb:path - LevelDB
##   - mapdb:path - MapDB
##   - memory - Contents are cleared when Orion exits
##
## Default: "leveldb"
storage = "leveldb"

## Optional IP whitelist for the public API. If unspecified/empty, connections from all sources
## will be allowed (but the private API remains accessible only via the IPC socket.) To allow
## connections from localhost when a whitelist is defined, e.g. when running multiple Orion nodes
## on the same machine, add "127.0.0.1" and "::1" to this list.
##
## Default: Not set
#ipwhitelist = ["10.0.0.1", "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334"]

## TLS status. Options:
##
##   - strict: All connections to and from this node must use TLS with mutual
##       authentication. See the documentation for 'tlsservertrust' and 'tlsclienttrust'
##   - off: Mutually authenticated TLS is not used for in- and outbound
##       connections, although unauthenticated connections to HTTPS hosts are still possible. This
##       should only be used if another transport security mechanism like WireGuard is in place.
##
## Default: "strict"
tls = "strict"

## containing the server's TLS certificate in Apache format. This is used to identify this
## node to other nodes in the network when they connect to the public API. If it doesn't exist it
## will be created.
##
## Default: "tls-server-cert.pem"
tlsservercert = "tls-server-cert.pem"

## List of files that constitute the CA trust chain for the server certificate. This can be empty
## for auto-generated/non-PKI-based certificates.
##
## Default: []
tlsserverchain = []

## The private key for the server TLS certificate. If the doesn't exist it will be
## created.
##
## Default: "tls-server-key.pem"
tlsserverkey = "tls-server-key.pem"

## TLS trust mode for the server. This decides who's allowed to connect to it. Options:
##
##   - whitelist: Only nodes that have previously connected to this node and
##       been added to the 'tlsknownclients' will be allowed to connect. This mode will
##       not add any new clients to the 'tlsknownclients' file.
##   - tofu: (Trust-on-first-use) Only the first node that connects identifying
##       as a certain host will be allowed to connect as the same host in the future. Note that
##       nodes identifying as other hosts will still be able to connect - switch to whitelist
##       after populating the 'tlsknownclients' list to restrict access.
##   - ca: Only nodes with a valid certificate and chain of trust to one of the
##       system root certificates will be allowed to connect. The folder containing trusted root
##       certificates can be overridden with the SYSTEM_CERTIFICATE_PATH environment variable.
##   - ca-or-tofu: A combination of ca and tofu: If a certificate is valid, it
##       is always allowed and added to the 'tlsknownclients' list. If it is self-signed, it
##       will be allowed only if it's the first certificate this node has seen for that host.
##   - insecure-no-validation: Any client can connect, however they will still
##       be added to the 'tlsknownclients' file.
##
## Default: "tofu"
tlsservertrust = "tofu"

## TLS known clients for the server. This contains the fingerprints of public keys of other
## nodes that are allowed to connect to this one for the ca-or-tofu, tofu and whitelist trust
## modes
##
## Default: "tls-known-clients"
tlsknownclients = "tls-known-clients"

## containing the client's TLS certificate in Apache format. This is used to identify this
## node to other nodes in the network when it is connecting to their public APIs. If it doesn't
## exist it will be created
##
## Default: "tls-client-cert.pem"
tlsclientcert = "tls-client-cert.pem"

## List of files that constitute the CA trust chain for the client certificate. This can be empty
## for auto-generated/non-PKI-based certificates.
##
## Default: []
tlsclientchain = []

## The private key for the client TLS certificate. If it doesn't exist it will be created.
##
## Default: "tls-client-key.pem"
tlsclientkey = "tls-client-key.pem"

## TLS trust mode for the client. This decides which servers it will connect to. Options:
##
##   - whitelist: This node will only connect to servers it has previously seen
##       and added to the 'tlsknownservers' file. This mode will not add any new servers to
##       the 'tlsknownservers' file.
##   - tofu: (Trust-on-first-use) This node will only connect to the same
##       server for any given host. (Similar to how OpenSSH works.)
##   - ca: The node will only connect to servers with a valid certificate and
##       chain of trust to one of the system root certificates. The folder containing trusted root
##       certificates can be overridden with the SYSTEM_CERTIFICATE_PATH environment variable.
##   - ca-or-tofu: A combination of ca and tofu: If a certificate is valid, it
##       is always allowed and added to the 'tlsknownservers' list. If it is self-signed, it
##       will be allowed only if it's the first certificate this node has seen for that host.
##   - insecure-no-validation: This node will connect to any server, regardless
##       of certificate, however it will still be added to the 'tlsknownservers' file.
##
## Default: "ca-or-tofu"
tlsclienttrust = "ca-or-tofu"

## TLS known servers for the client. This contains the fingerprints of public keys of other
## nodes that this node has encountered for the ca-or-tofu, tofu and whitelist trust modes.
##
## Default: "tls-known-servers"
tlsknownservers = "tls-known-servers"

## Verbosity level (each level includes all prior levels)
##
##   - 0: Only fatal errors
##   - 1: Warnings
##   - 2: Informational messages
##   - 3: Debug messages
##
## Default: 1
##
verbosity = 1
